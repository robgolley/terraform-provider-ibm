# ibm_is_lb
Create, update, or delete a VPC Load Balancer. For more information, about VPC load balancer, see [load balancers for VPC overview](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-nlb-vs-elb).

**Note:** 
VPC infrastructure services are a regional specific based endpoint, by default targets to `us-south`. Please make sure to target right region in the provider block as shown in the `provider.tf` file, if VPC service is created in region other than `us-south`.

```terraform
provider "ibm" {
  region = "eu-gb"
}

```

An example to create a network load balancer.

```terraform
